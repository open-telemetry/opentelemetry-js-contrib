# OpenTelemetry Baggage Span Processor for Node.js

[![NPM Published Version][npm-img]][npm-url]
[![Apache License][license-image]][license-url]

The BaggageSpanProcessor reads entries stored in Baggage from the parent context and adds the [baggage](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/baggage) entries' keys and
values to the span as attributes on span start.

Add this span processor to a tracer provider.

Keys and values added to Baggage will appear on subsequent child spans for a trace within this service *and* be propagated to external services in accordance with any configured propagation formats configured.
If the external services also have a Baggage span processor, the keys and values will appear in those child spans as well.

⚠ Warning ⚠️

Do not put sensitive information in Baggage.

To repeat: a consequence of adding data to Baggage is that the keys and values will appear in all outgoing HTTP headers from the application.

Compatible with OpenTelemetry JS API and SDK `1.0+`.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save @opentelemetry/baggage-span-processor
```

### Usage

Add to the span processors during configuration:

```javascript
import { NodeSDK, tracing } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-node";
import { BaggageSpanProcessor } from "@opentelemetry/baggage-span-processor";

const spanProcessors = [
  new tracing.SimpleSpanProcessor(
    new tracing.ConsoleSpanExporter()),
  new BaggageSpanProcessor()];

const sdk = new NodeSDK({
  serviceName: "example-service",
  spanProcessors
});

sdk.start();
```
