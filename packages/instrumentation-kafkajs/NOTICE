[Based on the instrumentation written by Aspecto](https://github.com/aspecto-io/opentelemetry-ext-js/tree/master/packages/instrumentation-kafkajs).

The library contains the following changes compared to the original:
* The codebase was converted to TypeScript.
* bufferTextMapGetter compares propagation headers in a case insensitive manner.
* Removed `moduleVersionAttributeName` configuration option.
* Changed the function signature of `producerHook` and `consumerHook`.
* Removed `messaging.destination_kind` attribute.
