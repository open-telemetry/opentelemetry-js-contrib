# OTel esbuild-plugin

This is a proposal for a `diagnostics_channel`-based mechanism for bundlers
to hand off a loaded module, at runtime, to possibly active OTel
instrumentations. This is an alternative proposal to
https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js-contrib/pull/1856

More details in the PR.

XXX obviously I need to fill this all in
