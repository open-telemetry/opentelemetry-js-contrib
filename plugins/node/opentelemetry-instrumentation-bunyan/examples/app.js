// A small example that shows using OpenTelemetry's instrumentation of

//    node --require ./telemetry.js app.js

const otel = require('@opentelemetry/api');
const bunyan = require('bunyan');

const log = bunyan.createLogger({name: 'myapp', level: 'debug'});

log.debug({foo: 'bar'}, 'hi');

const tracer = otel.trace.getTracer('example');
tracer.startActiveSpan('manual-span', span => {
  log.info('this record will have trace_id et al fields for the current span');
  span.end();
});
