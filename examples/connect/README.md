# Overview

OpenTelemetry Connect Instrumentation allows the user to automatically collect trace data and export them to the backend of choice (Collector Exporter), to give observability to distributed systems.

This is a simple example that demonstrates tracing calls made to Connect API. The example shows key aspects of tracing such as

- Root Span (on Client)
- Child Span (on Client)
- Span Events
- Span Attributes
