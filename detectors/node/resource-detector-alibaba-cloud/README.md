# OpenTelemetry Resource Detector for Alibaba Cloud

Resource detector for Alibaba Cloud.

The OpenTelemetry Resource is an immutable representation of the entity producing telemetry. For example, a process producing telemetry that is running in a container on Kubernetes has a Pod name, it is in a namespace and possibly is part of a Deployment which also has a name. All three of these attributes can be included in the `Resource`.

[This document][resource-semantic_conventions] defines standard attributes for resources.

Supports OpenTelemetry JS SDK 1.0
